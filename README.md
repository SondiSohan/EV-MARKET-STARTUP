# EV-MARKET-STARTUP
The electric vehicle (EV) market in India is at a pivotal stage of growth. With increasing environmental concerns and government initiatives promoting clean energy, the market is ripe for new entrants. Segmentation analysis is crucial for an EV startup to identify and target the right customer segments, ensuring a successful market.
* The Indian government aims to achieve 30% electric vehicle penetration by 2030. This ambitious target is supported by incentives such as subsidies on EV purchases, reduced GST rates, and investment in charging infrastructure. Additionally, the rise in fuel prices and increased awareness about environmental sustainability are influencing consumer preferences towards EVs.

Key players in the Indian EV market include Tata Motors, Mahindra Electric, Hero Electric, and Ather Energy. These companies are investing heavily in R&D to develop advanced and affordable EV models tailored to the Indian market.
